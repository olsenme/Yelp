<b>Implement endpoints<b><br>
  
  <li>Port will be 8003.</li>
  <li>Endpoints will have paginated responses where appropriate. </li>
  <li>Each API endpoint will respond with an appropriate HTTP status code and, when needed, a response body.</li>
  <li>Any API endpoint that takes a request body will perform basic verification of the data provided in the request body.</li>
  <li>Any API endpoint with a parameterized route will perform basic verification of the specified route parameters.</li>
  <li>A route will be included to implement each of the API endpoints in design. </li>
  <li>Server will be containerized into a Docker image with runtime dependencies.</li>
  <p>Containers launched from this image will automatically start the server listening on a specified port, and one should be able to successfully make requests to the containerized server from the outside world (e.g. from your host machine).</p>
<li><b>A MySQL database will be used to store:<b></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Businesses</li>
    <li>Reviews</li>
    <li>Photos</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Official MYSQL Docker Image will be used to power MySQL database.</li>
  <li>Database script will be used to initialize MySQL database upond first launch of container.</li>
  <li>Database will be persisted in Docker voume.</li>
   <li>API server will read the location(hostname,database Name) and credentials(username and password) from environment variables.</li><br>
  <b>A MongoDB will be used to store:<b>
    <ul>
      <li>Username</li>
      <li>Email Address</li>
      <li>Hashed/salted password</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Official Mongo Docker Image will be used to power MongoDb database.</li>
    <li>Script will be written to create a low-privileged user to use to connect to MongoDB server from Node.js.</li>
    <li>Three container application will be created and run via Docker Compose. </li>
  </ul>
